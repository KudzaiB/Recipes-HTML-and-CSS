    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs oxtail, cut into pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, sliced</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>1 cup red wine (optional)</li>
      <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour (for thickening, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the oxtail pieces with salt and black pepper.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
        Sear the oxtail pieces until browned on all sides. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and garlic. Saut√© for
        5-7 minutes until softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes to enhance its flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deglaze the pot with red wine, if using, scraping up any browned bits
        from the bottom of the pot. Let it simmer for 2-3 minutes to reduce
        slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the oxtail to the pot and pour in the beef broth. Add the thyme
        and bay leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours,
        stirring occasionally, until the oxtail is tender and the sauce has
        thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the sauce is too thin, mix 1 tablespoon of flour with 2 tablespoons
        of water to create a slurry, then stir it into the pot and let it cook
        for another 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with your choice of side dish, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
