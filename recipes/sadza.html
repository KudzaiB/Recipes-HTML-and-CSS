    <h2>Decription</h2>

    <p>
      Sadza is a traditional staple food in Zimbabwe and other parts of Southern
      Africa. Made from finely ground maize (cornmeal), it is a thick porridge
      that is served as the main dish in many households. It is similar to
      dishes like polenta or ugali found in other regions of Africa. Pair it
      with vegetables, chicken, or oxtail for a complete and satisfying meal.
