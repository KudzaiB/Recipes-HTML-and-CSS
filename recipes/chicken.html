    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken (about 4 lbs)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1 lemon, halved</li>
      <li>4 sprigs of fresh rosemary</li>
      <li>4 cloves of garlic, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).</li>
      <li>
        Clean the chicken by removing any excess fat and giblets, then pat it
        dry with paper towels.
      </li>
      <li>Rub the chicken with olive oil, ensuring it is evenly coated.</li>
      <li>
        Mix the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika in a small bowl and
        generously season the chicken inside and out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the lemon halves, rosemary sprigs, and crushed garlic cloves
        inside the chicken cavity for added flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Truss the chicken by tying the legs together with kitchen twine. This
        helps it cook evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breast-side up in a roasting pan or oven-safe dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven for about 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until
        the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C) when checked at the
        thickest part of the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baste the chicken every 20 minutes with its juices for extra crispiness
        and flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes
        before carving.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy your perfectly roasted chicken!</li>
    </ol>
